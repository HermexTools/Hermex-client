## Hermex-Client (Only for Windows)
Hermex is a instant sharing tool. Inspired by Puush and ScreenCloud, with this tool you can share instantly:
* a partial screen
* a complete desktop screen
* a file (that will be zipped)
* an entire file set (that will be zipped)
* the clipboard
obtaining immediately the direct sharing URL.

You can host all files in your server (via dedicated socket [server application](https://github.com/HermexTools/Hermex-server)) or web hosting space (via FTP).

Since this project is open source and c# written, feel free to fork, give suggestions or make pull requests.

### How to install
Actually simply run the binary file where you want, and it will save the configurations in the correct place.

### How to configure
Open Hermex-Client.exe, right-click on icon in the system tray, settings, and setup your client.

>Disclaimer: this is a project in early development stage. Since that it may change at any time.
